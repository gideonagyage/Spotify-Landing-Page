# Spotify Landing Page in React JS

## Overview

This project is part of the Codevixens Frontend Development Challenge (Day 5). It is a recreation of the Spotify landing page, built using React. It demonstrates how to structure a complex web page using React components, apply CSS styling, and implement responsive design principles.

## Features

- **Component-Based Structure**: The landing page is broken down into logical components (Header, Main Content, Footer) for better organization and maintainability.
- **CSS Styling**: Components are styled using CSS to match the visual design of the Spotify landing page.
- **Responsive Design (In Progressive)**: Media queries are used to ensure the landing page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Interactive elements like smooth scrolling are implemented to enhance the user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gideonagyage/Spotify-Landing-Page.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Spotify-Landing-Page
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to

```bash
http://localhost:3000.
```

## How it Works

The `SpotifyLandingPage` component is the main component that orchestrates the rendering of the landing page. It utilizes child components for each section:

1. **Header**: Renders the navigation bar, logo, and search bar.
2. **Main Content**: Contains the main sections of the landing page, such as featured artists, playlists, and recommendations.
3. **Footer**: Displays copyright information, links to other Spotify services, and social media links.

## Key Concepts

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Breaking down a complex UI into reusable and manageable components.
2. **CSS Styling**: Applying styles to components using CSS or CSS-in-JS libraries.
3. **Responsive Design (In Progress)**: Creating a website that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
4. **Smooth Scrolling**: Implementing smooth transitions for scrolling to specific sections of the page.
